        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 pound bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <p>Directions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, into smaller "tips." Season beef with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, arranging in a single layer. Let the meat sear until browned, 3 to 5 minutes, before turning over and browning the other side.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir everything until the butter melts, and then stir in the flour. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and cook until beef is starting to get tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Uncover, turn heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, and the meat is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While meat simmers, bake potato nuggets in the preheated oven until crispy and heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste beef tips and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately over hot potato nuggets.</li>
        </ol>
